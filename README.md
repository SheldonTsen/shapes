# K-means Community Detection Analysis

Note: This codebase was generated by Claude Code entirely. 

This project implements community detection using iterative k-means clustering followed by co-occurrence analysis on the multishapes dataset.

ðŸ“Š **See [results.md](results.md) for the complete analysis, methodology, and findings.**

## Setup with uv

1. Install uv if you haven't already:
   ```bash
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Analysis

```bash
python kmeans_analysis.py
```

This will:
- Load the multishapes.csv dataset
- Perform K-means clustering
- Generate visualization plots
- Display cluster analysis results
